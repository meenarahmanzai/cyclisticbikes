Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository showcases various data analysis projects I have completed, highlighting my skills in SQL, R, Tableau, and other tools. These projects reflect my passion for data-driven decision-making and my journey back to a field I have always loved: mathematics.

About Me

I am a social media coordinator with experience leading and executing social media campaigns. However, my true passion has always been math. When I was in college, I considered majoring in mathematics but wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the right path for me at the time. After years of working in a different field, I realized that my interest in math never faded. Instead, it evolved into something more practical and exciting, working with data.

This newfound passion led me to pursue a career in data analytics, where I can combine my problem-solving skills with my love for numbers. I hold a Bachelors in Business Administration with a focus in Marketing and a Google Data Analytics Certificate with hands-on experience with key analytics tools.
