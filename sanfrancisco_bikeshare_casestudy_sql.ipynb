Additionally, the top three most popular start and end stations are San Francisco Caltrain, San Francisco Caltrain 2, and Harry Bridges Plaza. To encourage more customers to become subscribers, we could implement a points system where riders earn points for each trip taken or distance ridden. We could also offer flexible subscription options, for example, a Pay-per-mile subscription option for long-distance riders. Furthermore, since the top three start stations are in high demand, ensuring bike availability is crucial for a positive user experience. We could implement a \"Station Full\" notification feature on our app to redirect riders to nearby stations when a station is full."
